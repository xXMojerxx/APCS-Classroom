# HELLO THERE!!! (-u-)/
Do ***YOU*** have trouble learning how to program in APCS? Well, I have (but not that very good) tutorial on how to programm efficiently (in my eyes)!!

There are multiple things that goes into programming in APCS (basically javascript)... but here are going to be the basics when learning how to program:
- Complicated Code .('=' ).
- Dot Functions .(c_c ).
- Functions .(>-< ).
- If/else Statement .(owo ).
- Input/Output .(._. ).
- Lists .(0-0 ).
- Loops .(x-x ).
- Variables (and opperators) .(-_- ).
- (will add more, maybe...)

***ALSO*** within this repositroy, I am going to add different programs/code to explain into further detail, for those who need better visualization on how code is created and applied towards your programs.

### PLEASE START WORKING ON YOUR APPS!!! THE MORE TIME YOU GUYS HAVE, THE MORE TIMES YOU CAN TEST AS WELL AS TIME TO REST THROUGHT THE SECOND SEMESTER
(btw there are 3 question "tests" at the end of each topic, so get familiar with what they are trying to say.)

There is also a small 5 question (so far) mock exam ***THAT IS NOT REAL*** that you can use just to touch up on certain things. But please take those questions with a grain of salt.
