# QUESTION 2

Here, we have a function that Jules created for his AP Calculus class:
```js
function addition (number) {
  if (number == 20){
    number = number + 15;
  } else if (number < 20) {
    number = number + 10;
  } else if (number > 20) {
    number = number + 1;
  }
}
console.log(addition(20));
console.log(addition(15));
console.log(addition(1));
```
What would be the outcome of the function?

A) 35, 25, 1

B) 25, 1, 35

C) 1, 25, 35

D) 35, 25, 16
