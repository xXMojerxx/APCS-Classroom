# FUNNY VARIABLES!! :D
There are many things that happen when programming, but the first thing that you learn would be **VARIABLES** Variables are the key comonents when adding certain events or creating a program in the first place. When programming, we first learn that are different ways to create and use a variable:
```js
var string = "string"; //This is a string value. Using text within your app/program

var number = 10; //This is a numberical value. used to use operators within your app/program

var list = ["first","second","third"]; //This is a list, you will learn about this later on....
```
As we can see, there are many ways to use variables within your program. But variables help define when your program starts.
## Lets look at a test program
```js

var name = "Aidan Florido,"; //First variable established under "name"
var age = 17 //Second variable established under "age"

console.log("Hello! My name is" + name + "and I am" + age "years old!");
//Uses concatenation to add this sentence together
```
As we can see, the first variable is assigned to "name", which is a string value indicated to the value assigned to the variable. When creating variables, we have to use appropriate names to correlate with the assignment value. For example, we would not have a variable name called "variable1" for a name, right?. Moving on, the second variable is assigned to "age", which is a numerical value. This numerical value tell us the age of the person given, which would be "17". 

***QUICK THING TO NOTE:*** String values will always have "quotation marks" around the value, while numberical values do not need them. <-- Only use numbers (durh)


### TESTING TIME :nerd-emoji:
1) What values are added to both of the variables?

2) What is the outcome of the program?

3) What can be changed to fit another person, for example "Jude Pulanco" and age 18?
