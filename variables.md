# VARIABLES .(-_- ).
> SORRY IF THERE IS ALOT OF INFORMATION (TRYING TO GET YOU GUYS TO UNDERSTAND :P)

There are many things that happen when programming, but the first thing that you learn would be ***VARIABLES***. Variables are the key comonents when adding certain events or creating a program in the first place. When programming, we first learn that are different ways to create and use a variable:
```js
var string = "string"; //This is a string value. Using text within your app/program

var number = 10; //This is a numberical value. used to use operators within your app/program

var list = ["first","second","third"]; //This is a list, you will learn about this later on....
```
As we can see, there are many ways to use variables within your program. But variables help define when your program starts.
## Lets look at a test program
```js

var name = "Aidan Florido,"; //First variable established under "name"
var age = 17 //Second variable established under "age"

console.log("Hello! My name is" + name + "and I am" + age + "years old!");
//Uses concatenation to add this sentence together
```
As we can see, the first variable is assigned to "name", which is a string value indicated to the value assigned to the variable. When creating variables, we have to use appropriate names to correlate with the assignment value. For example, we would not have a variable name called "variable1" for a name, right?. Moving on, the second variable is assigned to "age", which is a numerical value. This numerical value tell us the age of the person given, which would be "17". 

***QUICK THING TO NOTE:*** String values will always have "quotation marks" around the value, while numberical values do not need them. <-- Only use numbers (durh)

## ALONG SIDE VARIABLES... WE HAVE OPPERATORS!

Opperators are what is used to compare different things to one another. We have different opperators such as:

### COMPASIRON OPPERATOR

Comparison opperators compare two different values together. Usualy are used within if statements or loops to check if certain values are equal to one another or if one value is greater than another. For examples:
```js
var number1 = 2
var number2 = 3
var number3 = 2

if (number1 ==  number3){console.log("noice")} //Equal comparison opperator
if (number2 > number3){console.log("noice")} //Greater Than comparison opperator
if (number3 <= number3{console.log("noice")} //Less Than Or Equal To comparison opperator
```

### NUMERICAL OPPERATORS

Numerical opperators are operators that use numerical values and equations. Basically its math :/. Since we all know what math is, we can see that numerical opperators include:
```js
var question1 = 1 + 2; //Adding two values and assigns it to variable "question1"
var question2 = 20 - 6; //Subtracting two values and assigns it to variable "question2"
var question3 = 4 / 2; //Dividing two values and assigns it to variable "question3"
var question4 = 8 * 5; //Multiplying two values and assigns it to variable "question4"
var question5 = 5 % 2; //Uses MOD, divides and uses the remainder and assigns to variable "question5"
```

### ASSIGNMENT OPPERATORS
Its just a variable.... Yeah just assigns a value to a variable, which is a assignment opperator. 

### TESTING TIME 
1) What values are added to both of the variables?

2) What can be changed to fit another person, for example "Jude Pulanco" and age 18 (for the test program)?

3) What are the different types of opperators and how do they work?
